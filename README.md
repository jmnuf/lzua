# Lzua

This is a minor application that I have made to have a UI from which to see and launch my downloaded games that aren't part of any launcher or some dumb thing like that.

This is not meant as a manager of any kind, it's just a GUI app to find and execute a program. It is still in development and more features will be added in the future maybe.

## TODO
- [ ] Add actual scrolling of the listing.
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Have a `.lzua` config bi-format file that gets created when loading a directory
  - [ ] Have "cache" of the directory read, that we don't use just cause yes
  - [ ] Be able to alias program names
  - [ ] Be able to add simple custom meta-data to each item
- [ ] Be able to delete an app from listing and optionally from system as well
- [ ] Add a tooltip when hovering over an item
- [ ] Add context menu
  - [ ] Option for renaming (requires `.lzua`)
  - [ ] Option for adding custom data (requires `.lzua`)
